In my assignment, I will discuss how to reduce sodium in the diets of Americans. Sodium is being used heavily in restaurants, and even at home to provide more flavor for food. Sodium levels are becoming a rising issue in the health care community affecting millions. I will discuss how much/where sodium is found in foods, as well as creative ways to make sodium reduced foods. I will provide examples of sodium alternatives (such as substituting fruits/vegetables for chips or bread), as well as some examples of popular American foods (tacos) typically high in sodium, reduced to low sodium foods! In addition, I will provide details on what sodium is, how and why it is used, an the benefits and consequences of using it.
